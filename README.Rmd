# INTRODUCTION

The data set was taken from the website of the 
[national institute of informatics.](https://www.inegi.org.mx/datos/) 
Downloaded in excel format, it contains info about annual 
exportation of products by sector, given in thousands of USD.

![Excel file](README_files/excel_file.png)

The excel file is separated in different sheets per state. Each sheet 
contains the same information: annual exportation of products by sector, 
given in thousands of USD, where each column contains information of the
year, from 2007 to 2017.

# IMPORTING AND TIDYING THE DATA 

Due to the format of the file, our first step will be to tidy up the data
in a format that is useful to R and more manageable by us.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

  ## Calling libraries
  library(readxl)
  library(tidyverse)
  library(cowplot)

  ## Import from Excel

  ## The sheet names are the name of each state
  estados <- excel_sheets('ignore/EAEF_Entidad_Subsector.xlsx')
  ## Import column names and avoiding useless rows
  exportation <- read_xlsx('ignore/EAEF_Entidad_Subsector.xlsx',
                           range = "A5:N5", sheet = 1,
                           col_types = c("numeric", "text",
                                         rep("numeric", 12)))
  ## Create state column
  exportation <- mutate(exportation, state = "Aguascalientes")

  ## Iterate over every sheet
  for (i in 1:length(estados)){
      extracted <- read_xlsx('ignore/EAEF_Entidad_Subsector.xlsx',
                             range = "A7:N31", sheet = i,
                             col_names = F, na = "-",
                             col_types = c("numeric", "text",
                                           rep("numeric", 12)))
      colnames(extracted) <- colnames(exportation)[1:14]
      extracted <- mutate(extracted,
                          state = estados[i])
      exportation <- full_join(exportation, extracted)
  }

  ## Fix couple of column names
  colnames(exportation)[c(3, 14)] <- c("2007", "2018")
  exportation$`Código` <- parse_factor(as.character(exportation$`Código`))

  ## Tidying data
  export1 <- exportation %>%
      pivot_longer(cols = `2007`:`2018`,
                   names_to = "year",
                   values_to = "USD",
                   values_drop_na = T) %>%
      mutate(year = parse_double(year))

  export <- export1 %>%
      pivot_wider(names_from = "Descripción",
                  values_from = USD,
                  id_cols = c("state", "year"))

  ## Save our new data frames in a useful way
  write_csv(export1, "exportations_activity_rows.csv")
  write_csv(export, "exportations_activity_cols.csv")

```

Now we have 2 csv tables, `exportations_activity_rows.csv` (created from
`export1`) which keeps each activity as a row, and 
`exportations_activity_cols` (from `export`) which transform each activity
into a column using `pivot_wider`. Each of the 2 can help us to analyse
the data in different ways. We decided to keep them as csv files to make
its access easier for GitHub users.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Now if we start a new session, all we have to do is to call our libraries
and load the data from CSV:

```{r, include = T, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)

  export.rows <- read_csv("exportations_activity_rows.csv")
  export.cols <- read_csv("exportations_activity_cols.csv")
```

As the analysis developed, we found the importance of translating the
variable names to English. Not only for the reader to understand, but also
due to the long string and complexity of the categories in Spanish. I could
first translate and then save the csv files, however I encountered this
problem and fixed it once the csv files were already created, and in honour
to that, I decided to keep it in the same way for this publication. 
Therefore, before diving into the EDA, here is the code I used to translate
the variables from Spanish (ES) to English (EN).

```{r, include = T, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
## Spanish names in a vector
colnames(export.cols)
categorias <- colnames(export.cols)[3:27]

## Shorter equivalents in English
activities.en <- c("Total", "Food", "Drinks and tobacco",
                   "Textiles", "Textile products", "Tailoring",
                   "Paper", "Chemistry", "Plastic",
                   "Minerals based", "Metal industry", "Metal products",
                   "Machinery", "Electronics", "Transport equipment",
                   "Furniture", "Other manufactures", "Not specified",
                   "Mining", "Leather", "Wood",
                   "Printing", "Electricity", "Petroleum",
                   "Petroleum products")

## Change column names
colnames(export.cols)[3:27] <- activities.en
```

To change the values in `export.rows` we will need to convert the Spanish
expressions into English ones. Here functional programming comes very
handy: first we create our function `translate`, which will do the final
job, and then we fill the gaps, in this case, we create `equivalent`,
which will find the equivalent expression in each language. However,
`equivalent` must be run before `translate` to work.

```{r, include = T, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
translate <- function(vector.es){
    vector.en <- c()
    for (i in 1:length(vector.es)){
        expression.es <- vector.es[i]
        expression.en <- equivalent(expression.es)
        ## Here "equivalent" should take expression.es and return the
        ## equivalent in English
        vector.en <- append(vector.en, expression.en)
    }
    vector.en
}

equivalent <- function(expression.es){
    position <- match(expression.es, categorias)
    expression.en <- activities.en[position]
    expression.en
}

## Testing our new functions
equivalent("Impresión e industrias conexas")
translate(categorias)

## Creating a new column "Activity" with the English expressions
export.rows <- mutate(export.rows,
                      Activity = translate(`Descripción`))
```

Now to start with the EDA, let's look at the totals by state, using 
`export.cols`

```{r, include = T, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
  export.cols %>%
    group_by(state) %>%
    summarise(`total export` = sum(Total)) %>%
    arrange(desc(`total export`)) %>%
    print(n = Inf)

   ## Graphical mode
  export.cols %>%
      group_by(state) %>%
      summarise(`total export` = sum(Total)) %>%
      ggplot() +
      geom_bar(aes(y = `total export`,
                   x = reorder(state, `total export`, FUN = abs),
                   fill = `total export`),
               stat = 'identity') +
      coord_flip()
```

Now, to do the same but by category, we could simply use `export.rows`

```{r, include = T, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
export.rows %>%
    filter(Activity != "Total") %>%
    group_by(Activity) %>%
    summarise(Total = sum(USD)) %>%
    arrange(desc(Total)) %>%
    print(n = Inf)

export.rows %>%
    filter(Activity != "Total") %>%
    group_by(Activity) %>%
    summarise(Total = sum(USD)) %>%
    ggplot() +
    geom_bar(aes(y = Total,
                 x = reorder(Activity, Total, FUN = abs),
                 fill = Total),
             stat = 'identity') +
    coord_flip()
```

Finally, total exportations per year:

```{r, include = T, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
export.cols %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    summarise(`total export` = sum(Total)) %>%
    print(n = Inf)

## Visualisation
export.rows %>%
    filter(Activity == "Total") %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    summarise(Total = sum(USD)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = year, y = Total)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point() 

## Per state
export.rows %>%
    filter(Activity == "Total") %>%
    group_by(year, state) %>%
    summarise(Total = sum(USD)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = year, y = Total)) +
    geom_line(aes(colour = abbreviate(state, 6)))+
    geom_point(aes(colour = abbreviate(state, 6)))
```

We also would like to see if every year was the same state and/or the same 
activity making the biggest money by exportation, or if this changed with
the time. Unfortunately, our figure with the total exportation per year
grouped by state is quite messy and difficult to appreciate due to the big
number of states. Thus we need a different approach to that

```{r, include = T, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
## Main state per year
export.cols %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    filter(Total == max(Total)) %>%
    select(year, state, Total) %>%
    arrange(year)

## Activity
export.rows %>%
    filter(Activity != "Total") %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    filter(USD == max(USD)) %>%
    arrange(year) %>%
    select(Activity, state, year)
```

Our results are quite interesting: the main state until 2009 is *Baja California*,
and then it changes to *Chihuahua*, but when we look at the main activity 
exporting USD, the main states are *Campeche* until 2013 and then it 
changes to *Coahuila*. It seems that there is not a big difference between 
activities in the total USD produced by exportation, and that different 
combinations could lead to a bigger production in a single state. A good 
example of this is *Campeche*, who is the leader in the main exportation 
activity from 2007 to 2013, however it goes to the 6Th position when it 
comes to the total exportations overall. 

It could be interesting to look at the main states exporting, as well as 
the leading activities. 

# Interactive visualisation

We can create specific functions using our data frames to look directly at a 
given state or activity in order to make our analysis easier and find specific 
patterns.

```{r, include = T, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
## FUNCTION TO CHOOSE MAIN ACTIVITY PER STATE
plot_state <- function(estado, USD_min = 5000000){
    export.rows %>%
        filter(Activity != "Total") %>%
        group_by(state, Activity)  %>%
        summarise(Total = sum(USD)) %>%
        filter(state == estado &
               Total >= USD_min) %>%
        ggplot() +
        geom_bar(aes(y = Total,
                     x = reorder(Activity, Total, FUN = abs),
                     fill = Total),
                 stat = 'identity') +
        coord_flip() +
        labs(title = estado,
             y = "Total USD", x = NULL) +
        theme(legend.position="none")
}

## FUNCTION TO CHOOSE MAIN STATES IN A GIVEN ACTIVITY
plot_activity <- function(activity, USD_min = 5000000){
    export.cols %>%
        select(state, year, activity) %>%
        group_by(state)  %>%
        summarise(Total = sum(!!sym(activity))) %>%
        filter(Total >= USD_min) %>%
        ggplot() +
        geom_bar(aes(y = Total,
                     x = reorder(state,
                                 Total, FUN = abs),
                     fill = Total),
                 stat = 'identity') +
        coord_flip() +
        labs(title = activity,
             y = "Total USD", x = NULL) +
        theme(legend.position="none")
}
```

Now we can see particular states and activities. We can start with the main
6 states to see why are there differences in the main activities and main
states exporting.

```{r}
plot_grid(
    plot_state("Chihuahua") ,
    plot_state("Baja California"),
    plot_state("Coahuila de Zaragoza"),
    plot_state("Nuevo León"),
    plot_state("Tamaulipas"),
    plot_state("Campeche", USD_min = 10000),
    ncol = 2)
```

Despite of the fact that different states get their main exportation from 
different products, *Electronics* and *Transport equipment* are generally
in the first 2 places. Other activities such as *Machinery* and *Metal
products* also remain in the top exportations among the first 5 states. In
other words, there is a trend among the 5 states with the biggest 
exportation income with the kind of activities that are responsible for it.
However, this trend is totally broken in the case of *Campeche*, which is
on the 6Th place and main exportation activity is from *Petroleum*, which 
no other state in the top 5 shares. Nevertheless, petroleum or, *Extraction
of petroleum and oil* as it translates, is in the third position of main
activities responsible for exportations.

```{r}
export.rows %>%
    filter(Activity == "Electronics" |
           Activity == "Transport equipment" |
           Activity == "Petroleum") %>%
    group_by(year, Activity) %>%
    summarise(`Total per activity` = sum(USD)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = year, y = `Total per activity`)) +
    geom_line(aes(colour = Activity)) +
    geom_point(aes(colour = Activity))
```
It looks like the extraction of petroleum and oil has, at least since 2007,
been exporting less than the production of electronics and transport
equipment. And another interesting trend is observed in the last plot:
since 2009, the production of transport equipment had a considerable 
increase in its exportations.

Coming back to petroleum extraction, we can have a look at the top 
petroleum exporters using our `plot_activity` function

```{r}
plot_activity("Petroleum")
```

Only 4 states are exporting more than 5,000 million USD from petroleum.

```{r}
plot_grid(
    plot_state("Campeche", USD_min = 1000000),
    plot_state("Tabasco", USD_min = 1000000),
    plot_state("Veracruz de Ignacio de la Llave"),
    plot_state("Chiapas", USD_min = 1000000))
```

It seems that the economy of Tabasco, Campeche and Chiapas depends in a big
extent on the extraction of petroleum, unlike Veracruz which has other
strong activities such as Chemistry, Metalurgical and Food industries.
